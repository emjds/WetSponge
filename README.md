#WetSponge
Yet another Minetest sponge mod
##What is WetSponge?
WetSponge is a mod for Minetest that adds, you guessed it, a sponge!

It is meant to be a less laggy implementation of the traditional sponge mod.

##What does WetSponge do differently than the other sponge mods?
While most sponge mods use ABMs to achieve their goals, WetSponge uses single events, and therefore causes less lag.

##How to use the mod
Cook a single wool of any colour to recieve a sponge. A sponge can be placed to absorb the water in a 5x5x5 area, after which it will become a wet sponge. Pick up a wet sponge and place it in a furnace to dry it out, or right click on it with an empty hand to squeeze it and release a 5x5x5 area of source water. Dry sponges will also absorb water again if right clicked. A dry sponge that is next to a wet sponge that you pick up will become a wet sponge if water moves into it's absorption area.

##Contributions, bug reports, feature requests
I'm not currently considering accepting contributions. For features/bugs submit an issue. Github or Twitter are the best ways to contact me.

##Future updates
I plan on adding a few features to the mod, cleaning up the code a bit, making it more flexable. Main issues at the moment are:
*Cleanup
*Lava/Other liquid sponges (this may go in a seperate mod)
*More configurablility
*Keeping track of liquid amounts/types (very low priority)

##Licesnce
WetSponge is licensed under WTFPL.

Although not a requirement feel free to let me know if you're planning on including this in your modpack etc. for compatablity reasons and because I want to see y'all's cool ideas.
